# üöÄ Web3 Learning Journey: Blockchain, Smart Contracts & DApps
(for portuguese version, please read the file "LEIAME.md")

Welcome to my learning repository on **Blockchain** and **Web3 Development**! Here, you will find my progress as I dive deep into the world of smart contracts, decentralized applications (**DApps**), and the technologies that power this ecosystem.

## üéØ Repository Purpose

This repository is dedicated to documenting my learning journey, exploring the fundamentals and advancements in blockchain development, with a focus on creating and optimizing smart contracts in **Solidity** and building robust and secure **DApps**.

I am excited to learn and master:

- **Smart Contracts**: Development, testing, optimization, and security.
- **Decentralized Applications (DApps)**: Full-stack architecture and development on the blockchain.
- **Web3 Technologies**: Essential tools and libraries for building decentralized projects.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Tech Stack

Throughout this journey, I will be utilizing the best available tools and resources for blockchain and Web3 development. Below is an overview of the tools I am learning and using for my projects:

- **Solidity**: The primary programming language for smart contracts.
- **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**: Deep understanding of the EVM to optimize and debug smart contracts.
- **Remix IDE**: An environment for quick development and testing of Solidity contracts.
- **Hardhat**: A tool to compile, deploy, test, and debug Solidity contracts.
- **OpenZeppelin**: Libraries of secure and standardized smart contracts.
- **Ethers.js**: A library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Alchemy**: A platform for building DApps and connecting to the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Foundry**: A tool for testing and developing smart contracts.
- **GitHub**: For version control and hosting all the code generated during the learning process.
- **Zapier**: Automation to connect tools like Google Calendar, Notion, GitHub, and more.
- **Miro**: For creating diagrams and visual representations of blockchain concepts.
- **Trello & Toggl Track**: For task management and time tracking during development.

## üìö Study Structure

Here‚Äôs the structure of my learning schedule:

1. **Blockchain and Ethereum Fundamentals**: Basic understanding of the technology and architecture.
2. **Introduction to Solidity**: Learning the syntax, writing basic contracts, and deploying on the network.
3. **EVM & Gas Optimization**: How the Ethereum Virtual Machine works and how to optimize gas consumption.
4. **Smart Contract Testing & Security**: Testing and auditing contracts to ensure security.
5. **DApp Development**: Connecting smart contracts to decentralized interfaces.

## üìù Documentation and Projects

Each section of my learning will be documented and organized into specific folders for each topic:

- **/Blockchain-Basics**: Fundamental blockchain and Ethereum concepts.
- **/Solidity-Contracts**: Smart contracts I‚Äôve developed during the learning process.
- **/DApp-Projects**: Decentralized applications developed to connect contracts to the blockchain.
- **/Optimization-Guides**: Tips and practices for gas optimization and contract efficiency.
